# Task: validate-course

## Purpose

Checks the consistency, completeness, and LiaScript syntax correctness of the project memory and course materials.
Can be run in two modes:

- **Session mode** (`:validate-course {number} {type}`) — checks a single material file after co-authoring
- **Course mode** (`:validate-course`) — checks the entire course before publishing

## Inputs

- `journal.md` → `## Course Context` — course type and conventions
- `journal.md` → `## Templates` — LiaScript template imports, macros, and examples (if present)
- `checklists/course-quality-checklist.md` — structured checklist
- `tasks/validate-syntax.md` — full LiaScript syntax check, called as a sub-procedure (single source of truth for syntax rules)
- `data/duration-heuristic.md` — reading time + activity time estimate, compared against the declared duration
- `data/didactic-methods.md` — Session Method `Erforderlich` checklists, if a session method is in use
- `templates/session-validation.yaml` — template for each stored session validation report
- File Structure mode from `journal.md` → `## Course Context` → `__File Structure:__` (see `data/file-structure-modes.md`)
- For session mode: the material document for this session (resolved per File Structure mode), matching overview row in `journal.md` → `## Sessions`, and matching `### {number}. {title}` subsection in `journal.md` → `## Sessions`
- For course mode: `journal.md` sections (`## Outline`, `## Didactics`, `## Agenda`, `## Sessions`) and all material documents (`materials/` in multi-file mode, or the `##` chapters of root `README.md` in single-file mode)

## Output

- **Session mode**: create or replace `#### Validation Report` inside the matching session subsection in `journal.md` → `## Sessions`
- **Course mode**: validate all material files and create or replace `#### Validation Report` inside each matching session subsection in `journal.md` → `## Sessions`

## Validation Storage

Per-session validation is stored directly with the matching session in `journal.md` → `## Sessions`.
Each session has at most one current validation report, rendered from `templates/session-validation.yaml`.

Rules:
- Store the report under the matching `### {number}. {title}` session subsection.
- The report heading is always `#### Validation Report`.
- Wrap the entire rendered report in a single `<section>…</section>` block (same technique as `#### Images` in `tasks/create-image.md`), so LiaScript shows it as one slide instead of splitting on every `#####`/`######` subheading — see `data/liascript-cheat-sheet.md` → "Additional Rule: Subheadings within a Slide".
- If the session already has a `#### Validation Report`, replace it completely.
- Do not keep historical session validation reports.
- Session mode does not update `journal.md` → `## Validation`.
- Full course validation replaces `journal.md` → `## Validation` → `### Latest Validation Summary` for publishing decisions.
- For publishing decisions, use `### Latest Validation Summary` as the authoritative course-level gate state.
- Publishing requires `Mode: course` and `Result: PASS`; a passing session-mode validation never unlocks publishing by itself.

## Session Mode Steps (`:validate-course {number} {type}`)

1. Load `journal.md` → `## Course Context` for course type and conventions.
2. Load `journal.md` → `## Agenda` to get the learning objectives for this session.
3. Load `data/liascript-cheat-sheet.md` as syntax reference.
4. Open the material document for this session — resolved from `journal.md` → `## Course Context` → `__File Structure:__` (see `data/file-structure-modes.md`): `materials/{number}-{slug}/README.md` in multi-file mode, or the matching `##` chapter in root `/README.md` in single-file mode — and check:

   **Content checks:**
   - [ ] All learning objectives from `journal.md` → `## Agenda` for this session are addressed
   - [ ] No section is vague, content-free, or placeholder-only
   - [ ] References present where content claims are made
   - [ ] Content satisfies the `Erforderlich` (required elements) checklist of this session's declared type in `journal.md` → `## Didactics` → `__Session Types:__` (see `data/session-types.md`). If the type has no required elements defined, flag this as a Session Types gap rather than skipping the check.
   - [ ] `[if the session has a **Method:** line]` Content satisfies the `Erforderlich` checklist of the declared Session Method in `data/didactic-methods.md` — checked independently of, and in addition to, the Type check above.
   - [ ] Estimated duration per `data/duration-heuristic.md` (reading time + activity time, not word count alone) is within 70%–150% of the declared duration for this session in `journal.md` → `## Agenda`. This is always advisory — record the flag either way, never fail the report on this alone.

   **Persona & style checks:**
   - [ ] Tone matches the Coauthor role from `journal.md` → `## Agents` → `### Coauthor`
   - [ ] Terminology matches `journal.md` → `## Course Context` (sessions-called, etc.)

   **LiaScript syntax checks:**
   - Run `tasks/validate-syntax.md` for this material and fold its findings into this report. Do not restate the individual syntax rules here — `validate-syntax.md` is the single source of truth for them.

   **Template checks** `[if `journal.md` → `## Templates` exists or the material uses template macros]`:
   - [ ] Every template macro used in the material is documented in `journal.md` → `## Templates`
   - [ ] The material metadata header includes the matching `import: {url}` line for every used template
   - [ ] The project metadata header includes the matching `import: {url}` line for every documented template
   - [ ] Template use follows the examples and constraints documented in `## Templates`

5. Fill `templates/session-validation.yaml` for this session with:
   - Material path
   - Result: PASS / FAIL / PASS with concerns
   - Mode: session
   - Date
   - Content findings
   - Type consistency findings
   - Persona & style findings
   - LiaScript syntax findings
   - Template findings, if applicable
   - Recommended actions
   - Line references where possible
6. Create or replace the rendered `#### Validation Report`, wrapped in `<section>…</section>` (see Validation Storage rules above), in the matching session subsection under `journal.md` → `## Sessions`.
   Then run `tasks/update-dashboard.md` with `templates/project-dashboard.yaml` to update `journal.md` → `## Dashboard` in place.
7. If no issues found: confirm "Session {number} ({type}) — ✅ Syntax and content verified. Report saved in `journal.md` → `## Sessions` → `### {number}. {title}` → `#### Validation Report`."
8. If issues found: confirm the report was saved, list the blockers briefly, and ask the instructor whether to open `:coauthor-materials` to fix them.

## Course Mode Steps (`:validate-course`)

1. Load `journal.md` → `## Course Context` to understand course type and applicable conventions.
2. Load `checklists/course-quality-checklist.md` — apply only the checks relevant for this course type (skip sections marked with conditions that don't apply).
3. Load `data/liascript-cheat-sheet.md` as syntax reference.

4. **Check Context & Foundation:**
   - `journal.md` → `## Course Context` complete (course type, terminology, agenda flag, conventions)
   - `journal.md` → `## Outline`: title, target audience, time commitment `[not single-lesson]`, abstract, learning objectives
   - `journal.md` → `## Didactics`: instructor persona, didactic concept, style, difficulty level, Session Types (each with slug, criterion, and required-elements checklist)
   - `journal.md` → `## Didactics` has both `__Didactic Framework:__` and `__Default Session Method:__` set (the latter may explicitly be `none`). If either is missing entirely, flag this as a gap rather than silently skipping — same principle as an undefined Session Type (see `data/didactic-methods.md`).
   - `journal.md` → `## Agents` exists and contains scoped `### Coauthor` and `### Learner Personas` containers

4b. **Check Templates** `[if `journal.md` → `## Templates` exists or material files use template macros]`:
   - Every template documented in `journal.md` → `## Templates` has a matching `import: {url}` line in the main project metadata header
   - Every material file using a documented template macro has the matching `import: {url}` line in its own LiaScript metadata header
   - Template usage in materials follows the documented examples and constraints in `## Templates`

5. **Check Agenda** `[if agenda flag = yes in journal.md → ## Course Context]`:
   - All sessions have title, duration, type, learning objective, summary
   - `[if journal.md → ## Didactics → __Default Session Method:__ is not "none"]` All sessions have a Method assigned
   - Learning objectives align with `journal.md` → `## Outline`

6. **Check Session Progress:**
   - Load `journal.md` → `## Sessions` as primary source
   - Confirm the overview table appears directly below `## Sessions`
   - All expected sessions have a row in the overview table
   - Cross-check: every ✅ Skeleton row has a matching `### {number}. {title}` subsection in `journal.md` → `## Sessions`
   - Cross-check: every ✅ Material row has its material document present — a file in `materials/{number}-{slug}/README.md` in multi-file mode, or a matching `##` chapter in root `/README.md` in single-file mode (see `data/file-structure-modes.md`)
   - All sessions marked ✅ Done `[required before publishing]`

7. **Check each material document** (same LiaScript + content checks as Session Mode Step 4).
   For each material file, fill `templates/session-validation.yaml` with `Mode: course` and create or replace the matching `#### Validation Report`, wrapped in `<section>…</section>` (see Validation Storage rules above), in that session subsection under `journal.md` → `## Sessions`.

8. **Consistency check across project memory and materials:**
   - Terminology consistent (sessions-called from `journal.md` → `## Course Context` used throughout)
   - Persona tone consistent across all materials
   - Learning objectives from `journal.md` → `## Outline` traceable through `journal.md` → `## Agenda` into materials
   - Numbering correct and no gaps

9. **Replace `journal.md` → `## Validation` → `### Latest Validation Summary`:**

   ```
   Date: YYYY-MM-DD
   Mode: course
   Course type: [type]
   Result: PASS / FAIL / PASS with concerns
   Issues found: N
   Sessions checked: N

   #### Course-Level Findings
   ##### Foundation
   - [issue or ✅ OK]

   ##### Templates
   - [issue or ✅ OK / SKIPPED]

   ##### Agenda
   - [issue or ✅ OK / SKIPPED (course type)]

   ##### Session Progress
   - [issue or ✅ OK]

   ##### Materials
   - Session {N} — {title}: [issue or ✅ OK]

   ##### Consistency
   - [issue or ✅ OK]

   #### Recommended Actions
   1. [Concrete action with file reference]
   ```

10. Run `tasks/update-dashboard.md` with `templates/project-dashboard.yaml` to update `journal.md` → `## Dashboard` in place (validation state, publishing gate, session progress).
11. After all session validation reports and the latest summary are created: suggest next step.
    - If issues exist: "Open `:coauthor-materials {number} {type}` to resolve the issues in Session X, then rerun `:validate-course`."
    - If no issues: "Course is ready for publishing. Next step: `:agent development` → `:create-project`"

### Iteration (mechanical checks only)

**Loop:** Repeat "fix `[mechanical]` issues → rerun `:validate-course`" until every `[mechanical]`-tagged item in `checklists/course-quality-checklist.md` passes, or after 5 iterations — whichever comes first.

- In scope for the loop: LiaScript syntax findings from `tasks/validate-syntax.md`, broken links/alt text, missing required elements, structural gaps, and the duration flag from `data/duration-heuristic.md` — everything tagged `[mechanical]`.
- Never auto-loop on `[pedagogical]`-tagged items — always surface those to the instructor immediately (core rule: critical sparring partner, not a rubber stamp).
- On hitting the 5-iteration cap without a clean mechanical pass: stop, list the remaining `[mechanical]` FAIL items, and hand back to the instructor instead of continuing.
- See `CLAUDE.md` → "Iteration Pattern" for the general convention. Under Claude Code this can additionally be driven with `/goal "journal.md → ## Validation → ### Latest Validation Summary shows all [mechanical] checklist items passing, or stop after 5 iterations"`.

## Publishing Gate

**Enforced after every course-mode validation run. Controls access to publishing commands.**

| Result                 | Agent behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔴 FAIL               | Block publishing. State: "⛔ Publishing Gate: FAIL. Please resolve all issues in `journal.md` → `## Validation` and rerun `:validate-course`. `:create-project` and `:update-project` are locked until PASS." |
| 🟡 PASS with concerns | Ask: "There are open points, but no critical blockers. Do you want to proceed to publishing anyway? (Yes / No / Resolve issues first)"                                                                            |
| 🟢 PASS               | Only if `Mode: course`: suggest handoff: "✅ Publishing Gate: PASS. Ready for publishing. Next step: `:agent development` → `:create-project`"                                                                                          |

**Rule:** Never suggest or assist with `:create-project` or `:update-project` unless `journal.md` → `## Validation` → `### Latest Validation Summary` contains both `Mode: course` and `Result: PASS` — regardless of how the instructor asks.
