# Task: create-didactics

## Purpose

Creates the document **Course Didactics & Style**.  
Defines the didactic concept, instructor persona, style, and course type.  
Builds on the outline to ensure a consistent teaching strategy aligned with the course type from `journal.md` → `## Course Context`.

## Inputs

- Abstract from `journal.md` → `## Outline`
- Target audience from `journal.md` → `## Outline`
- Learning objectives from `journal.md` → `## Outline`
- Course type & conventions from `journal.md` → `## Course Context`
- `data/didactic-methods.md` — course frameworks, session methods, and their default suggestions by course type

## Output

- `journal.md` → `## Didactics`, including `__Session Types:__`
- `journal.md` → `## Agents` → `### Coauthor` updated with the coauthor role derived from the professor persona, teaching style, project-specific rules, and persona voice sample
- Structure based on `templates/course-didactics.yaml`

## Steps

1. Read `journal.md` → `## Course Context` for course type, persona type, and conventions.
2. Read abstract, target audience, and learning objectives from `journal.md` → `## Outline`.
3. 💬 Design a suitable didactic concept (teaching methods, learning phases) adapted to the course type — discuss with instructor if unclear:
   - **lecture-series**: structured phases, presenter-driven, attendance-based
   - **self-paced**: modular, learner-driven, self-check oriented
   - **workshop**: activity-driven, collaborative, time-boxed
   - **single-lesson**: focused, compact, single arc
3a. 🎛️ Propose a **Didactic Framework** from `data/didactic-methods.md` → "Course Frameworks", based on course type. Let the instructor confirm or change it. This is documentation/vocabulary only — it does not change any later step's behavior.
3b. Define `__Session Types:__` (see `data/session-types.md` for the full mechanism):
   - **single-lesson**: default to one type named after `lectures-called`; skip the discussion unless the instructor wants to split the lesson into sub-types.
   - **all other course types**: 🎛️ propose the default Session Types for this course type from the table in `data/session-types.md`, each with slug, one-line criterion, and a 2–3 item required-elements checklist. Let the instructor confirm or edit.
   - 💬 Grounding check (mandatory, do not skip): ask the instructor to name one concretely planned session and which Session Type it would get, and why. If the answer doesn't fit any proposed type, revise the types before continuing — don't let an unfitting default stand.
3c. 🎛️ Propose a **Default Session Method** from `data/didactic-methods.md` → "Session Methods", based on course type — include the option to pick **`none`** (no specific method, opt out entirely). Let the instructor confirm, change, or opt out. This becomes the course-wide default; `:create-agenda` can override it per session later.
4. 💬 Describe the instructor persona (expertise, role, background) — free text, discuss with instructor.
5. 🎛️ Define teaching style (structured question — single choice with optional free-text addition):
   - humorous / academic / practical / conversational / mixed
6. 🎛️ Set difficulty level (structured question — single choice):
   - beginner / intermediate / advanced
7. Set the delivery format consistent with the course type.
8. Fill the `templates/course-didactics.yaml` template with the results.
9. Save the generated didactics by replacing the content of `journal.md` → `## Didactics` — flat `* __Label:__` bullets only (including `* __Persona Voice Sample:__`), no sub-headings.
10. Create or update `journal.md` → `## Agents` → `### Coauthor` directly, with no `#### Coauthor` subsection:
    - Set `* __Customization Status:__ active`
    - Set `* __Role / Persona:__` from `## Didactics` → `__Professor Persona:__`
    - Set `* __Behavior Additions:__` from the teaching style, didactic concept, and project-specific coauthoring needs
    - Set `* __Preferred Interaction Style:__` from the selected teaching style
    - Set `* __Project-Specific Rules:__` from course type, time format, target platform, and material constraints
    - Set `* __Persona Voice Sample:__` from `## Didactics` → `__Persona Voice Sample:__`
    - Preserve `* __Boundaries / Never:__` and keep it additive-only; never override workflow gates, validation rules, safety rules, or epistemic rules
11. Run `tasks/update-dashboard.md` with `templates/project-dashboard.yaml` to update `journal.md` → `## Dashboard` in place.
