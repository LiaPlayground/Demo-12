# Task: validate-syntax

## Purpose

The single source of truth for LiaScript syntax validation of one material document — derived from every normative section of `data/liascript-cheat-sheet.md`. Other tasks call this task as a sub-procedure instead of re-describing syntax rules themselves, so the rules are defined once and never drift out of sync across `validate-course`, `quick-fix`, `build-session`, and the quality checklist.

## Command

`:validate-syntax {number} {type}` — checks LiaScript syntax for one session's material document.

This task is also invoked internally (not just via the command) by `tasks/validate-course.md` (session and course mode), `tasks/quick-fix.md` (mini-validation), and `tasks/build-session.md` (content loop) — those tasks call it as a sub-procedure rather than repeating the checks below.

## Inputs

- `number`, `type`
- The material document for this session — resolved from `journal.md` → `## Course Context` → `__File Structure:__` (see `data/file-structure-modes.md`): `materials/{number}-{slug}/README.md` in multi-file mode, or the matching `##` chapter in root `/README.md` in single-file mode
- `data/liascript-cheat-sheet.md` as the syntax reference
- Optionally, a narrower scope (e.g. "only the changed section") when called by `quick-fix.md`

## Output

- A structured findings list: rule, ✅/❌, line reference where possible.
- **When called as a sub-procedure:** return the findings list to the calling task — do not write to `journal.md` directly; the caller decides where the combined report lands (e.g. inside `#### Validation Report`).
- **When run standalone via `:validate-syntax`:** report the findings to the instructor directly in chat; no `journal.md` write.

## Steps

1. Resolve the material document (or the given narrower scope) per the Inputs above.
2. Load `data/liascript-cheat-sheet.md` as the syntax reference.
3. Run every check below against the material, noting rule, ✅/❌, and line reference where possible.
4. If invoked as a sub-procedure: return the findings list to the caller — do not ask the instructor anything.
5. If invoked directly: report the findings using the Output Format below.

## Checks

1. **Metadata header** (cheat sheet §1): `author`, `email`, `version`, `language`, `narrator` present and well-formed in the `<!-- ... -->` header block.
2. **Heading structure** (§2): exactly one `#` heading (course title); every `##` starts a new slide; a bare `###` directly under a `##` is fine; `####`-or-deeper only inside a `<div>`/semantic wrapper, a list, or a blockquote — never bare.
3. **Code blocks** (§8): every fenced code block opened with triple backticks is closed; correct language tag used (`js`, `py`, `html`, etc.); interactive code blocks pair a `<script>`/`@input` block directly after the code block where applicable.
4. **Alerts** (§3): alert blockquotes use only supported types (`NOTE`, `TIP`, `IMPORTANT`, `WARNING`, `CAUTION`); every line of the alert starts with `>`.
5. **Citations** (§3): citation blockquotes have a `--` source line, preceded by an empty `>` line.
6. **Animations & TTS** (§4, §14): `--{{n}}--` / `{{n}}` numbering resets to 0 after each `##`; every `{{n}}` animated content block has a matching `--{{n}}--` TTS comment; narrator overrides use the `<!-- narrator: ... -->` form; `{{|>}}` play-button syntax is well-formed where used.
7. **Media** (§5): every `![]`, `?[]`, `!?[]`, `??[]` element has meaningful alt text/caption.
8. **Diagrams** (§6): Mermaid code blocks tagged `@mermaid`; ASCII diagrams tagged `ascii`.
9. **Formulas** (§7): inline `$...$` and block `$$...$$` LaTeX delimiters correctly paired.
10. **Quizzes & surveys** (§10, §10b): classic quiz syntax (`[(X)]` single choice, `[[X]]` multiple choice, `[[answer]]` text quiz, `?[...]` open question) **and** survey variants (`[[___]]` text input, single-/multi-choice vector, single-/multi-choice matrix) are correctly formed.
11. **Includes** (§11): `@import`/`@include` reference existing local/external targets and use the correct directive for local vs. external content.
12. **Variables & macros** (§12): `@var` variables are defined (header or comment block) before use and used consistently throughout.
13. **HTML blocks**: no unclosed `<div>` (or other HTML container) blocks.

## Output Format

```
Syntax check: {material path}

1. Metadata header — ✅/❌ [findings]
2. Heading structure — ✅/❌ [findings, line refs]
3. Code blocks — ✅/❌ [findings, line refs]
4. Alerts — ✅/❌ [findings, line refs]
5. Citations — ✅/❌ [findings, line refs]
6. Animations & TTS — ✅/❌ [findings, line refs]
7. Media alt text — ✅/❌ [findings, line refs]
8. Diagrams — ✅/❌ [findings, line refs]
9. Formulas — ✅/❌ [findings, line refs]
10. Quizzes & surveys — ✅/❌ [findings, line refs]
11. Includes — ✅/❌ [findings, line refs]
12. Variables & macros — ✅/❌ [findings, line refs]
13. HTML blocks — ✅/❌ [findings, line refs]

Result: PASS / FAIL (N issues)

## Relation to other tasks

| Task | How it uses `validate-syntax` |
|---|---|
| `validate-course.md` | Calls it for every material file in session and course mode; folds the findings into `#### Validation Report` |
| `quick-fix.md` | Calls it scoped to the changed area during mini-validation |
| `build-session.md` | Calls it (via `validate-course`) inside the content loop's mechanical gate |
| `coauthor-materials.md` | May call it optionally during drafting as a self-check |

Do not duplicate the checklist above inside any of these tasks — reference this file instead.
